mining.notify params:
job_id - ID of the job. Use this ID while submitting share generated from this job.
prevhash - Hash of previous block.
coinb1 - Initial part of coinbase transaction.
coinb2 - Final part of coinbase transaction.
merkle_branch - List of hashes, will be used for calculation of merkle root. This is not a list of all transactions, it only contains prepared hashes of steps of merkle tree algorithm. Please read ï‚¬ some materials (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_tree) for understanding how merkle trees calculation works. Unfortunately this example don't have any step hashes included, my bad!
version - Bitcoin block version.
nbits - Encoded current network difficulty
ntime - Current ntime/
clean_jobs - When true, server indicates that submitting shares from previous jobs don't have a sense and such shares will be rejected. When this flag is set, miner should also drop all previous jobs, so job_ids can be eventually rotated.
